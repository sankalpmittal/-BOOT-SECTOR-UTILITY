Files


==========================
BOOT.bin
==========================
This File contains a boot sector,
that was Created from BOOT.asm 

==========================
BOOT.asm
==========================
This is the Boot Program.

When you boot your computer with this
program this would happen.

1) You would get a message like this

	Ready to start Loading the OS...

2) Press any Key

3) After it finishes reading a track he would
	Display a string like this "~~~~" and 
	it would wait for a key struck.

4) After it finishes reading 5 Tracks it would print
	a Message "Done."

5) Thats it.

==========================
Compile.BAT
==========================
Like how I compiled BOOT.ASM with TASM & TLINK.

==========================
BOOT.exe
==========================
This is the EXE from were I Took the BOOT sector.

(It seems that in WinXP and before you can't use EXPLORER to
delete an 16 bit exe, so to delete BOOT.exe Make 
a bat file in write to it "Del BOOT.exe". Actually you can do the same in Windows 10. I checked. Previous versions, it seems not.)
